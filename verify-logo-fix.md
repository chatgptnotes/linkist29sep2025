# ✅ Fixed: Duplicate Logo Removed from All NFC Pages

## Issue
The Linkist logo was appearing twice in the top-left corner on NFC pages (checkout, payment, success, etc.)

## Solution
Updated `components/ConditionalLayout.tsx` to remove the duplicate logo from ALL `/nfc/` pages, not just the configure page.

## Changes Made
- Changed condition from checking only `/nfc/configure` to checking all pages starting with `/nfc/`
- This affects:
  - `/nfc/configure` - Card configuration page
  - `/nfc/checkout` - Checkout page
  - `/nfc/payment` - Payment page
  - `/nfc/success` - Order success page

## Verification
Visit these pages to confirm the logo no longer duplicates:
- http://localhost:3002/nfc/configure
- http://localhost:3002/nfc/checkout
- http://localhost:3002/nfc/payment
- http://localhost:3002/nfc/success

## Technical Details
The NFC pages have their own logo in the page component, so the ConditionalLayout header now shows an empty spacer instead of the logo to maintain layout consistency while avoiding duplication.

## Result
- ✅ No duplicate logo on NFC pages
- ✅ Layout spacing maintained
- ✅ User dropdown still visible in top-right corner
