## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- **Core Auto-Accept System**: Complete autonomous confirmation handling for Claude Code
- **Intelligent Security Assessment**: Risk-based decision making with configurable patterns
- **Session Management**: Time and count-based limits for safe operation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail with structured logging using Winston
- **CLI Interface**: Complete slash command system for control and monitoring
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible environment-based configuration with validation
- **Hook Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code's confirmation system
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for all core functionality
- **Security Features**: 
  - Pattern-based operation filtering
  - Risk level assessment (low/medium/high)
  - Danger pattern blocking
  - Whitelist/bypass pattern support
  - Operation type restrictions
- **Development Tools**:
  - TypeScript configuration with strict typing
  - ESLint configuration for code quality
  - Jest testing framework
  - Development and build scripts
  - Makefile for common operations
  - Docker support
- **Documentation**: Complete README, API reference, and setup guides

### Security Features
- **Danger Pattern Detection**: Automatically blocks dangerous operations like `rm -rf`
- **Whitelist Patterns**: Allow known safe operations
- **Bypass Patterns**: Instant approval for confirmed safe operations
- **Operation Type Filtering**: Restrict to specific operation categories
- **Session Limits**: Prevent runaway auto-acceptance
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all decisions

### CLI Commands
- `auto-accept on` - Enable auto-accept mode
- `auto-accept off` - Disable auto-accept mode  
- `auto-accept status` - Show current status and configuration
- `auto-accept config` - Manage configuration (show/edit/reset)
- `auto-accept logs` - View audit logs with filtering
- `auto-accept test` - Test operation acceptance without executing

### Configuration Options
- **Core Settings**: Enable/disable, session timeout, max accepts
- **Security Settings**: Allowed operations, safety checks, patterns
- **Logging Settings**: Log levels, audit paths, rotation
- **Hook Settings**: Integration mode, monitoring options

### Supported Operation Types
- **Git Operations**: add, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase
- **File Operations**: mkdir, touch, read, write, delete
- **Network Operations**: fetch, download, upload, curl
- **System Operations**: install, update, restart, service management

### Built-in Safety Patterns

#### Danger Patterns (Always Blocked)
- `^rm\s+-rf` - Recursive force removal
- `^sudo\s+rm` - Privileged removal commands
- `^delete.*database` - Database deletion
- `^drop.*table` - Table dropping operations

#### Bypass Patterns (Always Allowed)
- `^Do you want to proceed` - Standard confirmation prompts
- `^Continue with` - Continuation prompts
- `^Are you sure` - Confirmation questions

#### Whitelist Patterns (Medium Risk Allowed)
- `^git\s+(add|commit|push|pull)` - Standard Git operations
- `^npm\s+(install|run)` - Package manager operations
- `^mkdir` - Directory creation
- `^touch` - File creation

### Development Features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Testing**: Jest with coverage reporting and watch mode
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules and auto-fixing
- **Build System**: TypeScript compilation with source maps
- **Development Server**: Watch mode with hot reloading
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit testing and linting
- **VS Code Integration**: Settings, extensions, and debug configurations

### Installation Methods
- **Automated**: One-command installation with `make install`
- **Manual**: Step-by-step setup with npm commands
- **Development**: Full development environment setup
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment option

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time session and configuration status
- **Audit Logging**: Structured logs with decision reasoning
- **Performance Metrics**: Session statistics and usage patterns
- **Health Checks**: Configuration validation and system checks

### What's Next
- Integration with Claude Code extension system
- Real-time configuration updates without restart
- Advanced pattern learning from user behavior
- Integration with external security tools
- Performance optimizations
- Additional operation type support
