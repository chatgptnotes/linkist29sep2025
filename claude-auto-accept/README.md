# Claude Code Auto-Accept ALL System

**AUTOMATIC CONFIRMATION ACCEPTANCE FOR CLAUDE CODE - NO MORE MANUAL APPROVALS**

This system automatically accepts ALL confirmation prompts from Claude Code, eliminating the need for any manual user intervention. When enabled, every single confirmation request will be automatically approved without asking.

## üöÄ Quick Start - AUTO-ACCEPT ALL MODE

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run and enable auto-accept ALL mode
node dist/index.js on --force

# Check status (should show ENABLED)
node dist/index.js status
```

That's it! Claude Code will now automatically accept ALL confirmations without asking you.

## ‚ö° What This Does

When enabled, this system:
- **Automatically accepts ALL confirmation prompts** - no questions asked
- **Never asks for your approval** - everything proceeds automatically
- **Handles all operations** - file changes, git operations, installations, everything
- **Works silently in the background** - you won't even know it's running
- **Maintains audit logs** - track what was auto-accepted

## üìã Features

- **100% Automatic**: Every confirmation is automatically accepted
- **No User Interaction Required**: Set it and forget it
- **All Operations Accepted**: Git, files, network, system - everything
- **Long Sessions**: 12-hour default session timeout
- **High Limits**: 10,000 auto-accepts per session
- **Full Audit Trail**: Log everything that was auto-accepted
- **Active Hook Mode**: Intercepts confirmations automatically

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Already Set for Auto-Accept ALL)

The system comes pre-configured for auto-accept ALL mode. The `.env.example` file contains:

```bash
# AUTO-ACCEPT ALL CONFIGURATION
AUTO_ACCEPT_ENABLED=true              # Always enabled
SESSION_TIMEOUT=720                   # 12 hours
MAX_AUTO_ACCEPTS=10000                # Virtually unlimited
ALLOWED_OPERATIONS=all                # Accept EVERYTHING
SAFETY_CHECKS_ENABLED=false           # No safety checks
WHITELIST_PATTERNS=.*                 # Match everything
BYPASS_PATTERNS=.*                    # Bypass everything
DANGER_PATTERNS=                      # No danger patterns
HOOK_MODE=active                      # Active interception
```

## üîß Usage Commands

### Enable Auto-Accept ALL Mode
```bash
node dist/index.js on --force
# OR just
npm run dev on --force
```

### Check Status
```bash
node dist/index.js status
# Should show: Mode: ENABLED
```

### Disable (If Needed)
```bash
node dist/index.js off
```

### View What Was Auto-Accepted
```bash
node dist/index.js logs
```

### Test Any Operation
```bash
node dist/index.js test "any_operation" "Any confirmation message?"
# Result: Would accept: YES (always in auto-accept all mode)
```

## üéØ Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Automated workflows** - No interruptions
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Fully autonomous
- **Batch operations** - Process everything without stopping
- **Development speed** - No more confirmation fatigue
- **Unattended operations** - Run tasks while away

## üî® Development & Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode (with auto-reload)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run built version
npm start

# Run with specific command
npm start -- status
npm start -- on --force
```

## üì¶ NPM Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Development mode with auto-reload
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` - Run the built application
- `npm test` - Run tests (updated for auto-accept all)
- `npm run lint` - Check code style
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix code style issues

## üö® Important Notes

**This system accepts EVERYTHING automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Git operations (commits, pushes, pulls)
- ‚úÖ File operations (create, delete, modify)
- ‚úÖ Network operations (downloads, uploads)
- ‚úÖ System operations (installs, updates)
- ‚úÖ Database operations (migrations, drops)
- ‚úÖ ANY other confirmation prompt

**There are NO safety checks when enabled** - it's designed to accept everything for maximum automation.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Intercepts all confirmation requests** from Claude Code
2. **Immediately returns "yes"** to every request
3. **Logs the decision** for audit purposes
4. **Continues without interruption**

The security checker is configured to:
```typescript
// ALWAYS ALLOW ALL OPERATIONS
return {
  decision: 'allow',
  riskLevel: 'low',
  reason: 'Auto-accept all mode - All operations automatically approved'
};
```

## üìä Monitoring

View the audit log to see what was auto-accepted:

```bash
# View recent auto-accepts
node dist/index.js logs

# Check log file directly
cat logs/auto-accept-audit.log
```

## üõ† Architecture

```
claude-auto-accept/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # Auto-accept agent (always accepts)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/         # CLI commands
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Config (defaults to accept-all)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/            # Confirmation interceptor
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/            # Security checker (accepts all)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/                 # Built JavaScript files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                 # Audit logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example          # Pre-configured for auto-accept all
```

## ‚ö° Performance

- **Zero delay**: Instant acceptance of all prompts
- **High throughput**: Handle 10,000+ confirmations per session
- **12-hour sessions**: Long-running operations supported
- **Minimal overhead**: Lightweight interception

## üéì Examples

### Example 1: Auto-Accept Everything
```bash
# Just run this once
node dist/index.js on --force

# Now ALL confirmations are automatically accepted
# Claude Code will never ask you for confirmation again
```

### Example 2: Check What's Being Accepted
```bash
node dist/index.js status
# Output:
# Mode: ENABLED
# Accepts used: 47/10000
# Time remaining: 11h 45m
```

### Example 3: Test Any Operation
```bash
node dist/index.js test "rm -rf /" "Delete everything?"
# Output:
# Would accept: YES
# Risk level: low
# Reason: Auto-accept all mode
```
